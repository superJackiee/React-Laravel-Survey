Laravel 6 survey
================

Docker documentation for the custom survey app in Laravel 6

Docker
======

I tried to make as simple as I could for you to be able to use the custom survey locally using docker with just one Alpine container.

```
# bash docker/install-container.sh
```

Go to http://localhost:59314/laravel after all the JavaScript and CSS assets were transpiled.
